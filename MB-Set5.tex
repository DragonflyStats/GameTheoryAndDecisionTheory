Cournot Duopoly with Heterogeneous items: Linear Demand and Linear
Costs
Let x1 and x2 be the quantities of heterogeneous or non-identical items produced by two
firms with associated costs C1(x1) = c1x1 and C2(x2) = c2x2 respectively.
Firm 1’s items sell at P1 = a1 − b11x1 − b12x2 each, firm 2’s at P2 = a2 − b21x1 − b22x2
each and it is assumed that all items produced are sold.
The profits made by the firms are then
π1 = P1x1 − c1x1 = (a1 − c1 − b11x1 − b12x2) x1
π2 = P2x2 − c2x2 = (a2 − c2 − b21x1 − b22x2) x2
respectively.
We’ll proceed with a specific example: P1 = 10 −

1250 , C1(x1) =
2.5x1, C2(x2) = 2x2. The profits made by the firms are then

Stackelberg Duopoly
We’ll consider a Stackelberg duopoly in which Firm 1 is the Leader and Firm 2 is the
Follower. Irrespective of what the leader does, the follower will use the reaction function
(Eq. 2) as its best response.
Knowing this, the leader seeks to maximise
