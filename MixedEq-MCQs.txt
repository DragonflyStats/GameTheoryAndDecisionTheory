Mixed Strategy Equilibria


Question 1.

 	 	Wumpus
 	 	Run	Hide
Hunter	Run	60 , 20	 0 ,  0
Hide	 0 ,  0	20 , 60
What is the mixed strategy equilibrium of the above game?
(Denote by p be the probability of "Run" for the Wumpus, and q the probability of "Run" for the hunter.)

 	p=1/4, q=1/4
p=1/2, q=1/2
p=1/4, q=3/4
p=3/4, q=1/4

Question 2.

Your accounting department announces that due to an error in its procedures, the numbers in the game from question 1 are wrong, and actually each number should be multiplied by 2. Does this change the equilibrium?
 	Yes
No
Maybe
It depends

Question 3.

The deities Mars and Venus often do battle to create the weather conditions on Earth. Venus prefers extreme temperatures (especially heat), while Mars prefers temperate conditions. The payoffs (expressed in Points of Wrath) are given below.
 	 	Venus
 	 	Warm	Chill
Mars	Warm	20 ,  0	 0 , 10
Chill	 0 , 90	20 ,  0
What is the unique mixed-strategy equilibrium of the above game?
(Let p be the probability of "Warm" for Mars, and q the probability of "Warm" for Venus.)

 	p=9/10, q=1/2
p=1/2, q=1/10
p=1/2, q=1/2
p=1/10, q=1/10

Question 4.

In the above game, who earns more Points of Wrath (on average) in equilibrium, Mars or Venus?
 	Mars
Venus
Same
It depends

Question 5.

 	 	Player 2
 	 	A	B	C
Player 1	X	8 , 4	4 , 8	1 , 1
B	4 , 8	8 , 4	1 , 1
C	1 , 1	1 , 1	0 , 0
What is the unique equilibrium of the above game? (HINT: Are any strategies dominated?)
 	(X,A)
Pr{A}=Pr{B}=Pr{C}=Pr{X}=Pr{Y}=Pr{Z}=1/3 (i.e., each player plays each startegy with equal probability)
Pr{A}=Pr{B}=Pr{X}=Pr{Y}=1/2 (i.e., players play A and B and X and Y with equal probability)
There is no equilibrium
Be careful. These are tricky!
 	 	Player 2
 	 	Left	Right
Player 1	Left	20 , -20	10 , -10
Right	5 , -5	40 , -40
Question 6.

If the payoffs in the top-left box change from [20 , -20] to [40 , -40], how would Player 1's equilibrium strategy change?
 	Player 1 would play Left more often
Player 1 would play Left less often
Player 1 would play Left just as often
It depends
Question 7.

If the payoffs in the top-left box change from [20 , -20] to [40 , -40], how would Player 2's equilibrium strategy change?
 	Player 2 would play Left more often
Player 2 would play Left less often
Player 2 would play Left just as often
It depends
Question 8.

If the payoffs in the bottom-left box change from [5 , -5] to [10 , -10], how would Player 1's equilibrium strategy change?
 	Player 1 would play Left more often
Player 1 would play Left less often
Player 1 would play Left just as often
It depends
Question 9.

If the payoffs in the bottom-left box change from [5 , -5] to [10 , -10], how would Player 2's equilibrium strategy change?
 	Player 2 would play Left more often
Player 2 would play Left less often
Player 2 would play Left just as often
It depends
