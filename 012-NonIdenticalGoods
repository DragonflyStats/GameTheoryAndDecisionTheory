\subsection*{Bertran Duopoly - Identical Goods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Firms set their prices $p_1$, $p_2$ simultaneously.
The quantity sold by each firm depends on both prices.\\
In particular, if $p1 < p2$, then firm 1 sells the entire
market demand $D(p_1)$ while firm 2 sells zero.\\
The reverse happens when $p_1 > p_2$.
\item If $p_1 = p_2 = p$, then each firm sells $1/2 D(p)$.
\begin{framed}
\textbf{Nash equilibrium:} A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) such that
neither firm can do better by unilaterally deviating and
charging some other price.
\end{framed}
\end{itemize}
There are several possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) where $\hat{p}_1$ > $\hat{p}_2$ > c.
In this situation firm 1 earns zero profit. Firm 1 would
be better off unilaterally deviating and charging a price
p1 just below $\hat{p}_2$.
That way, firm 1 would make strictly positive profit.
So this cannot be a NE.
\item A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) where $\hat{p}_2$ > $\hat{p}_1$ > c : ruled
out similarly.

\item A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) where $\hat{p}_1 = \hat{p}_2$ (= $ \hat{p}$) > c
In this case firm 1 earns profit = 1
2D(pb)(pb − c)
If it unilaterally deviates a charge a price slightly below p, b
its profit will be approximately (slightly below) D(pb)(pb−
c), almost double of what it was getting.
So, this cannot be a NE.

\item A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) where $\hat{p}_1$ > $\hat{p}_2$ = c.
In this situation both firms earn zero profit. Firm 2 would
be better off unilaterally deviating and charging a price
p2 just below $\hat{p}_1$ but higher than c.
That way, it (firm 2) would make strictly positive profit.
So this cannot be a NE.

\item A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) where $\hat{p}_2$ > $\hat{p}_1$ = c: ruled
out similarly.

\item A pair of prices ($\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$) where $\hat{p}_1$ = $\hat{p}_2$ = c.
In this case, both firms earn zero profit.
Further, no firm can deviate and do better i.e., strictly
positive profit.
This is a NE.
It is the unique NE.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Bertrand Paradox}
\begin{itemize}
\item If firms are identical, the unique NE is one where firms
set their prices = MC and the industry output is at the
socially optimal level.
\item Both firms earn zero profit.
\item Even with two firms - market power disappears.
\item If more than 2 firms - same outcome.
\end{itemize}

Assumptions of the Bertrand: rule out certain important
elements of real markets.
1. Product Differentiation:
In Betrand model, firms sell identical product
\begin{itemize}
\item firms can grab all buyers from rival by charging a slightly
lower price (undercutting).
Real world: differentiated products
\item consumers may not switch to another firm simply because
it charges a lower price (care about difference in
product attributes)
\item  incentive for a firm to undercut rival’s price is much
less.
\end{itemize}
