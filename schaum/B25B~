\subsection{Solution of a matrix game by the simplex method.}
Suppose we are given a matrix game $A$. We assume that $A$ is non-strictly determined and does not contain any 
recessive rows or columns. We obtain the solution to $A$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Add a sufficiently large number
(The purpose of this step is to guarantee that the value of the new matrix game is positive.)
\item[(2)] Form the following initial tableau:
The tableay corresponds to the linear programming problem:
\item[(3)] Solve the above linear programming problem by the simplex method. Let $P$ be the
optimum solution to the maximum problem, $Q$ the optimum solution to the dual minimum problem.
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Add a sufficiently large number $k$ to every entry of A to form,say, the following matrix game which has only positive entries:
(The purpose of the step is to guarantee that the value of the new matrix game is positive).
\item
\item
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\section{Summary}
In finding a soultion to the matrix game, you should follow the following steps.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Test to see if the game is strictly determined.
\item[(2)] Eliminate all recessive rows and columns.
\item[(3)] In the case of $2 \times 2$, use the following formula in Theorem 25.3
\item[(4)] In the case of a $2 \times m$ or an $m \times 2$, reduce the game to a $2 \times 2$ game.
\item[(5)] Use the simplex method in all other cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exercise 25.2}
Find the solution to the following $2 \times 2$ matrix game.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] The game is non-strictly
\item[(2)] The game is strictly determined with saddle point -1
\item[(3)] The game is non-strictly determined.
\item[(4)] The game is non-strictly determined. First compute $a+d-b-c = -3-3-2-5 = -13$
Then $x_1 = 5/13, x_2 = 8/13,y_1=8/13,y_2=5/13$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exercise 25.3}
Find the solution to the following matrix game.
First circle each row minimum and box each column maxmimum.
Observe there is no saddle point and so the game is not strictly determined.
We now test for recessive rows and columns.
Not that the third column is recessive since each entry is larger than the corresponding entry in the
second column. Hence the third column can be omitted to obtain the game.
