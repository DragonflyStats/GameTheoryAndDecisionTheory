%=====================================================%
1. Data Collection - 1.1 Types of Data
The methods of statistical analysis available depend on the type of
data we are dealing with. Data can be broadly classified into two
types:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quantitative Data: Numeric data that indicates how
much or how many: e.g. height, mass, number of
children.
\item Qualitative Data: Normally classifications or
groupings, e.g. gender, university department, social
class. Note that classifications may use numeric
labels. However, such variables are still qualitative,
e.g. Department: 1-Maths, 2- Equine studies,
3-Sociology (i.e. the numbers here are not counted
or measured).
\end{enumerate}
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Types of Quantitative Data}
Quantitative data may be further split into
1. Continuous variables. Such variables can take any
value in a certain range. They are usually measured
according to some scale, e.g. age, height, mass.
2. Discrete variables. Such variables take values from a
set that can be listed (commonly integer values).
Such variables are often counted, e.g. number of
children, number of subjects passed at leaving
certificate
%=====================================================%

Note that continuous variables are only measured to a given
accuracy.
e.g. Age is normally given to the closest year. However, in theory
it could be measured much more accurately.
When a discrete variable takes a very large number of values , e.g.
the number of individuals employed by a firm, it may be treated for
practical purposes as a continuous variable.
%=====================================================%
Types of Qualitative Data
Qualitative data may be further split into
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nominal classifications. Such data is defined by a
pure classification, in which the order of the classes
has no practical interpretation, e.g. Department:
1-Maths, 2-Equine studies, 3-Sociology.
\item Ordinal classifications. The order of the
classification is important, e.g. 1. Non-smoker, 2.
Light Smoker, 3. Heavy Smoker, i.e. the higher a
number the more an individual smokes.
\end{enumerate}
It is important to distinguish between quantitative variables and
classifications using numeric labels, e.g. the mean of a discrete
variable has a sensible interpretation, but not the mean of a
nominal, or even ordinal, variable.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{1.2 Sampling}
Suppose we wish to study a particular group of individuals, e.g.
Irish teenagers, Irish voters, or European students.
The population in a study is the entire group of individuals that
we wish to investigate (as above).
Since it is impractical to observe all the individuals in a population,
we observe a sample of the population in question.
A unit is any individual member of the population.
%=====================================================%
\section{Sampling}
\begin{itemize}
\item A sampling frame is a list of members of a population. It may be
used to choose a sample.
\item A sampling frame may be incomplete or inaccurate. For example,
the Irish electoral register will be a complete sampling frame for the
population of eligible voters in Ireland. However, it will not be a
complete sampling frame for the population of adult Irish residents.
\item Choice of an inappropriate sampling frame may well lead to
systematic errors in estimates obtained from sampling (bias).
\item If I tried to measure the mean mobile data usage of the whole Irish
population by just observing a sample of Irish students, I would
tend to overestimate this population mean.
\end{itemize}
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Example}
Suppose we wish to do a study of recent immigrants to Ireland and
classify their occupation, e.g. managerial, professional, retail,
unemployed.
We may use the register of PPS numbers given to non-nationals in
the past 3 years as a sampling frame.
Such a sampling frame will not be completely accurate as some of
these immigrants will have already left Ireland and some
immigrants will not have registered.
A sample from this population is the set of individuals we choose
to observe.
The main variable observed in this study is the class of occupation.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{1.3 Parameters and Statistics}
A parameter is a numeric characterisation of the population (its
value is usually unknown).
e.g. 13% of all recent immigrants have professional occupations.
A statistic is a numeric characterisation of the sample (observed).
12.4% of individuals in our sample have professional occupations.
Statistics can be used to estimate the parameters of the
population, e.g. here we would estimate that 12.4% of all recent
immigrants have professional occupations.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{1.4. Accuracy of Estimates - Bias and Precision}
As described above, if we use an inappropriate sampling frame, our
estimates of parameters may have a systematic bias.
Bias that results from our method of sampling is called sampling
bias. Other sources of bias exist (see later).
Also, we have random errors depending on the sample actually
observed. This determines the precision of a study.
Consider the hypothetical situation in which we have a large
number of small samples. The mean heights in these samples will
be rather variable, i.e. a small sample leads to low precision.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Bias and Precision}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we had many large samples. The mean heights in these
samples will be similar to each other (and if the sampling frame is
appropriate will also be similar to the population mean).
\item In this case we have low bias and high precision (ideal).
Now suppose we observe the heights of Irish students in order to
estimate the mean height of the population of Irish adults. When
we have a large number of small samples, the sample means will be
rather variable and tend to be larger than the mean height of all
Irish adults (large bias and low precision).
\item Increasing the size of these samples would increase the precision
(the sample means would be more similar), but the bias is
unaffected (the mean height will still tend to be overestimated as
the sampling frame is inappropriate).
\end{itemize}
Hence, increasing the sample size will increase the precision of a
study.
However, increasing sample size leaves the bias unaffected.
Moral: Results may be misleading, even when we have large
sample sizes, as inappropriate methods for choosing samples may
lead to systematic bias.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Non-sampling Bias}
This is a form of bias that occurs when certain groups of
individuals have a tendency to give inaccurate responses or not
give an answer.
For example, it was noticed that UK political polls systematically
underestimated the support of the Conservative party in the 80s
and 90s.
This may well have been due to the fact that Conservative
supporters were more likely to hide their preferences than
supporters of other parties.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Non-sampling Bias}
\begin{itemize}
\item The wording of a questionnaire, who the interviewer is and what
the interviewee perceives to be the ”right” answer in a given
situation may also lead to bias.
\item For example, suppose a questionnaire is carried out on how willing
people are to pay extra for ”ecologically friendly goods”.
Such a survey will tend to overestimate the proportion of
individuals willing to pay extra, as it is politically correct to express
such a willingness.
\item Suppose in survey I there are the options a) not willing to pay
more, b) willing to pay 10% more. Suppose in survey II, option b)
is replaced by ”willing to pay 20% more”. It is likely that survey II
would indicate that on average people are willing to pay more for
”ecologically friendly goods” (this is also an example of why you
should not calculate a mean for data categorised in such a way ).
\end{itemize}
%=====================================================%
\subsection{1.5 Types of Sampling}
1. Simple Random Sampling
A sample is a simple random sample (SRS) if the probability of
picking any collection of n units from the sampling frame as a
sample does not depend on the collection of units, i.e. individuals
are picked completely ”at random” from the population.
Advantages: 1. Simple, 2. If the sampling frame is appropriate,
then there is no sampling bias.
Disadvantages: If the population can be divided into units called
strata, which have different characteristics, more precision can be
obtained by using Stratified Random Sampling (see below).

2. Stratified Random Sampling
The population is divided into strata according to various
characteristics, e.g. sex, occupation, age.
A simple random sample is taken from each stratum, so that the
proportions of individuals taken from each stratum equals the
proportion of individuals in the population as a whole within that
stratum.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Stratified Random Sampling}
Advantages:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item If the sampling frame is appropriate and the
proportions of individuals in each stratum known, then there is no
sampling bias.
\item If the strata are different in their characteristics, this method
leads to increased precision.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages: 1. Complexity, increased time required to collect
samples.
2. The proportions of individuals in each stratum should be known
accurately for the method to be effective.
%=====================================================%
\subsection{3. Systematic sampling}
Suppose we wish to sample a fraction 1/k of the population. One
individual is chosen from the first k units listed in the sampling
frame and each k-th individual is chosen from then onwards, i.e. if
I want to choose 1% of the population, I may choose number 53
from the first 100, then numbers 153, 253,. . . are also picked.
Advantages and Disadvantages: Same as simple random
strategies, except that it is more difficult to control the precision if
the list is not ordered randomly with respect to the variables of
interest.
e.g. If one wanted to study earnings in a given population, it would
be reasonable to choose subjects from an alphabetic list using
systematic sampling.
However, it would not be reasonable to choose the subjects in such
a way from a list of highest earners (i.e. with the highest earners
at the top).
%=====================================================%
\subsection{4. Convenience Sampling}
The sample is chosen so as to minimise the costs of obtaining a
sample, i.e. questioning friends and colleagues, inviting volunteers
etc.
Advantages: 1. Simplicity, 2. Low sampling costs.
Disadvantages: 1. The sample may not be representative (i.e.
there is sampling bias). For example, when we invite responses on
some political issue (e.g. immigration), we are more likely to get
responses only from those who have rather extreme views on that
issue. If we invite respondents to a study on the mathematical
abilities of students, mathematically gifted individuals are more
likely to volunteer than non-gifted individuals.

%=====================================================%
\subsubsection{5. Expert Sampling}
An expert chooses a sample that he feels is representative of the
population as a whole.
Advantages: 1. If the method employed by the expert is
appropriate, this may well result in increased precision.
Disadvantages: 1. An inappropriate method will lead to bias.

\subsubsection{Probability Sampling}
These methods can be more broadly defined into probability and
non-probability sampling.
Probability sampling occurs when the probability that an individual
is picked to be in a sample does not depend on the individual.

The first 3 methods described above are forms of probability
sampling. Note: Stratified random sampling is a form of
probability sampling as long as the correct proportions of
individuals in the various strata are known.
Such methods are advantageous as much can be said about the
distribution of the statistics obtained from such a sample (see
below).
%=====================================================%
\subsection{1.6 Sampling Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\ite  Suppose we observed a large number of samples of size n of the
height of Irish adults. The distribution of the sample means would
look like the distribution below:
\item 
If an appropriate sampling frame were used, then this sampling
distribution would be centred around the true mean height of the
population.
\item 
The larger the sample size, the more concentrated the distribution
around the true population mean.
\end{itemize}
%=====================================================%
\subsection{1.7 Critical analysis of a poll}
To assess the credibility of a study, we should ask the following
questions.
1. Who carried out the survey? (This
person/organisation might have a hidden agenda).
2. What methods were used in choosing a sample? How
large is the sample? (sampling bias, precision)
3. How was the information gained? This may well
affect the validity of the data obtained. The reaction
of an interviewee to the interviewer is important.
4. How were the questions formulated? (see example on
buying environmentally friendly goods).
5. What was the response rate? A low response rate
could lead to bias, as non-responders may well differ
from respondents.
