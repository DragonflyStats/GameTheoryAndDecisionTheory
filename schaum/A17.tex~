\section{Game Theory}

If one player wins wwhat player loses, the game is called a zero-sum game. A two person game is a game with only two players.

Two person, Zero-sum games,also called matrix games,will be the focus here.
\subsection{Stratgies}

A pure strategy is a predetermined plan that prescribes for a player the sequence of moves and countermoves they will make
during a complete game.
In a matrix, either player has a finite set of pure strategies, although their number may be enormous

Thus a complete characterization of the game is provided by its pay-off matrix.
Table 1.7 gives the amount$a_{ij}$ won by player 1 from player II when I players their $i$th pure strategy.


The objective is game theory is to determine a best stategy for a given player under the assumption that the opponent is rational and will 
make intelligent countermoves. Consequently, if one player always chooses the same pure strategy or chooses pure strategies in a fixed order, their oppponent will in time

recognize patterns and will move to defeat if possible.

Generally, therefore, the most effective strategy is a mixed staategy.


%% -- \subsection{Example 17.2}
If the game in example 17.1 , if player 1 always shows three fingers, player II can defeat that pure strategy by always showing two fingers.
If player I adopts the set sequence of pure strategies \{3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,2\}, then player II can defeat it with the corresponding sequence
\{2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,3, \ldots\}.

If player I adopts the mixed strategy $\boldsymbol{X} =\[1//6,1/3,1/2\}^T$, then player I plans to show 1 fnger one-sixth of the time, 2 fingers one-third of the time, and 3 fingers one-half of the time.

To implement the strategy, player i could roll one die before each play.

If the die showed a 1 (having probability of 1/6), they would show 1 finger, if the die showed a 2 or 3 ( having combined probability of 1/3)
they would show 2 fingers.

In a well known gambling game, player I holds a red ace and a black deuce, while player II holds
a red deuce and a black three.
Simultaneously, both players show one card of their choice.
