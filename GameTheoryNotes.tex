Categorical Game
A game in which no draw is possible.

Steinhaus (1999, p. 16) stated that all categorical games are unfair, but this is incorrect. For example, the game "Odds or Evens" pits player O against player E. Each puts out some fingers, and O wins if the total number of fingers is odd. Odds or Evens has no draws, but it is fair.

\section{What is Game Theory}

Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that uses models to study interactions with formalised incentive structures ("games"). 

Unlike decision theory, which also studies formalised incentive structures, game theory encompasses decisions that are made in an environment where various players interact strategically. In other words, game theory studies choice of optimal behavior when costs and benefits of each option are not fixed, but depend upon the choices of other individuals.



Game theory is the science of strategic reasoning, in such a way that it studies the behaviour of rational game players who are trying to maximise their utility, profits, gains, etc., in interaction with other players, and therefore in a context of strategic interdependence.

Game theory has applications in a variety of fields, including economics,  international relations, evolutionary biology, political science, and  military strategy. Game theorists study the predicted and actual  behaviour of individuals in games, as well as optimal strategies.  Seemingly different situations can have similar incentive  structures, thus all exemplifying one particular game. 


\subsection{Types of Games}

In game theory, the unscrupulous diner's dilemma (or just diner's dilemma) is an n-player prisoner's dilemma. The situation imagined is that several individuals go out to eat, and prior to ordering, they agree to split the check equally between all of them. Each individual must now choose whether to order the expensive or inexpensive dish. It is presupposed that the expensive dish is better than the cheaper, but not by enough to warrant paying the difference when eating alone. Each individual reasons that the expense s/he adds to their bill by ordering the more expensive item is very small, and thus the improved dining experience is worth the money. However, having all reasoned thus, they all end up paying for the cost of the more expensive meal, which by assumption, is worse for everyone than having ordered and paid for the cheaper meal.

\subsection{Cooperative game}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A cooperative game is a game wherein two or more players do not compete, but rather strive toward a unique objective and therefore win or lose as a group.
	
	\item 	Cooperative games are rare, but still many exist. One example is "Stand Up", where a number of individuals sit down, link arms (all facing away from each other) and attempt to stand up. This objective becomes more difficult as the number of players increases.
	
	\item 	Another is the counting game, where the players, as a group, attempt to count to 20 with no two participants saying the same number twice. In a cooperative version of volleyball, the emphasis is on keeping the ball in the air for as long as possible.
	
	\item 	Cooperative games are rare in recreational gaming, where conflict between players is a powerful force. However, such scenarios can occur in real life (when the sense of the word "game" is extended beyond recreational games). For example, operation of a successful business is, at least in theory, a cooperative game, since all participants benefit if the business succeeds and suffer if it fails.
	
	\item 	Role-playing games are the most common form of cooperative game, though these games are not always purely cooperative. In such games, the players (who act through personae called "characters") usually strive toward intertwined and similar goals. However, each character has his or her own ambitions, and ultimately, individual goals. Hence conflict between characters often occurs in these games.
\end{itemize}
%=========================================================================%
\subsection{Winner's Curse}
The winner's curse is a phenomenon that may occur in common value auctions with incomplete information. In short, the winner's curse says that in such an auction, the winner will tend to overpay. The winner may overpay or be "cursed" in one of two ways: 1) the winning bid exceeds the value of the auctioned asset such that the winner is worse off in absolute terms; or 2) the value of the asset is less than the bidder anticipated, so the bidder may still have a net gain but will be worse off than anticipated.[1] However, an actual overpayment will generally occur only if the winner fails to account for the winner's curse when bidding (an outcome that, according to the revenue equivalence theorem, need never occur).

%=========================================================================%
\subsection{Axiomatic bargaining}
Two players may bargain how much share they want in a contract. The theory of axiomatic bargaining tells you how much share is reasonable for you. For example, Nash bargaining solution demands that the share is fair and efficient (see an advanced textbook for the complete formal description).

However, you may not be concerned with fairness and may demand more. How does Nash bargaining solution deal with this problem? Actually, there is a non-cooperative game of alternating offers (by Rubinstein) supporting Nash bargaining solution as the unique Nash equilibrium.

\section{Nash Equilibrium}

Nash Equilibrium recommnds a strategy to each player that the player cannot improve upon unilaterally, as long as the other players follow the recommendation.

Since the other olayers are assumed to be rational, it is reasonable to expectt the opponents to follow the recommendation as well.
Game Theory


the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his or her own strategy.[1] If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium. 

The Nash equilibrium is one of the foundational concepts in game theory.


%===========================================================%

\subsection{Informal definition}
Informally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing his or her strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks themselves: "Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?"

If any player could answer "Yes", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a best response to all other strategies in that equilibrium.

The Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because it may happen that a Nash equilibrium is not Pareto optimal.

The Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in sequential games because players may "threaten" each other with non-rational moves. For such games the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.

\section{Prisoner’s dilemma}

The prisoner’s dilemma is probably the most widely used game in game theory. Its use has transcended Economics, being used in fields such as business management, psychology or biology, to name a few. Nicknamed in 1950 by Albert W. Tucker, who developed it from earlier works, it describes a situation where two prisoners, suspected of burglary, are taken into custody. However, policemen do not have enough evidence to convict them of that crime, only to convict them on the charge of possession of stolen goods.

\begin{verbatim}
Example PD payoff matrix
Prisoner 2
Prisoner 1
Cooperate (with other)	Defect (betray other)
Cooperate (with other)	2, 2	0, 3
Defect (betray other)	3, 0	1, 1
\end{verbatim}

Imagine two prisoners held in separate cells, interrogated simultaneously, and offered deals (lighter jail sentences) for betraying their fellow criminal. They can "cooperate" (with the other prisoner) by not snitching, or "defect" by betraying the other. However, there is a catch; if both players defect, then they both serve a longer sentence than if neither said anything. Lower jail sentences are interpreted as higher payoffs (shown in the table).

The prisoner's dilemma has a similar matrix as depicted for the coordination game, but the maximum reward for each player (in this case, 3) is obtained only when the players' decisions are different. Each player improves their own situation by switching from "cooperating" to "defecting", given knowledge that the other player's best decision is to "defect". The prisoner's dilemma thus has a single Nash equilibrium: both players choosing to defect.

What has long made this an interesting case to study is the fact that this scenario is globally inferior to "both cooperating". That is, both players would be better off if they both chose to "cooperate" instead of both choosing to defect. However, each player could improve their own situation by breaking the mutual cooperation, no matter how the other player possibly (or certainly) changes their decision.




Prisoner's dilemmaIf none of them confesses (they cooperate with each other), they will both be charged the lesser sentence, a year of prison each. The police will question them on separate interrogation rooms, which means that the two prisoners cannot communicate (hence imperfect information). The police will try to convince each prisoner to confess the crime by offering them a “get out of jail free card”, while the other prisoner will be sentenced to a ten years term. If both prisoners confess (and therefore they defect), each prisoner will be sentenced to eight years. Both prisoners are offered the same deal and know the consequences of each action (complete information) and are completely aware that the other prisoner has been offered the exact same deal (therefore, it’s common knowledge).

Takeaway Points
To calculate payoffs in mixed strategy Nash equilibria, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Solve for the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Write the probabilities of playing each strategy next to those strategies.
	\item	For each cell, multiply the probability player 1 plays his corresponding strategy by the probability player 2 plays her corresponding strategy. Write this in the cell.
	\item	Choose which player whose payoff you want to calculate. Multiply each probability in each cell by his or her payoff in that cell.
	\item	Sum these numbers together. This is the expected payoff in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for that player.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Description:}

Since prisoners cannot communicate and will (supposedly) make their decision at the same time, this is considered to be a simultaneous game, and can be analysed using the strategic form, as in the adjacent game matrix. 

As described before, if both prisoners confess the crime they will be charged an eight years sentence each. If neither confesses, they will be charged one year each. If only one confesses, that prisoner will go free, while the other will be charged a ten years sentence. These can be seen as the respective payoffs for each set of strategies.

\subsection{Prisoner's dilemma - Nash and Pareto equilibria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Eliminating all dominated strategies, in order to get the dominant strategy, can solve this game. This is, each prisoner will analyse their best strategy given the other prisoner’s possible strategies. Prisoner 1 (P1) has to build a belief about what choice P2 is going to make, in order to choose the best strategy. If P2 confesses (P2C), he will get either -8 or 0, and if he lies (P2L) he will get either -10 or -1. 
	
\item It can be easily seen that P2 will choose to confess, since he will be better off. Therefore, P1 must choose the best strategy given that P2 will choose to confess: P1 can either confess (P1C, which pays -8) or lie (P1L, which pays -10). The rational thing to do for P1 is to confess. 
	
\item	Proceeding inversely, we analyse the beliefs of P2 about P1’s strategies, which gets us to the same point: the rational thing to do for P2 is to confess. Therefore, “to confess” is the dominant strategy. P1C, P2C is the Nash equilibrium in this game (underlined in red), since it is the set of strategies that maximise each prisoner’s utility given the other prisoner’s strategy.
	
\item Nash equilibriums can be used to predict the outcome of finite games, whenever such equilibrium exists. On the downside, we find the issue that arises when dealing with a Nash equilibrium that is neither social nor ethical, and where efficiency may be subjective, which is the case in the prisoner’s dilemma, where the Nash equilibrium does not meet the criteria for being Pareto optimal (underlined in green).
	
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Generalisation of the game:}

The prisoner’s dilemma is not always presented as we have seen in this case. Payoffs for each set of strategies will vary, depending on each person. However, there are a few rules that can be used to build a “proper” prisoner’s dilemma game.

Prisoner's dilemma - StructureIn the adjacent game matrix, we’ve renamed each player’s payoffs, in order to determine the conditions needed to design a prisoner’s dilemma game. In a traditional prisoner’s dilemma, we have: A > B > C > D (in absolute terms). In our previous example, this condition is met (A=10, B=8, C=1 and D=0). In every case, A>B and C>D imply that confess-confess is a Nash equilibrium.

It must be noted that the asymmetry of the game is not the important part of the prisoner’s dilemma. The interesting thing about this game is the fact that its Nash equilibrium is not socially optimum.



\subsection{Repeated prisoner’s dilemma games:}

In order to see what equilibrium will be reached in a repeated game of the prisoner’s dilemma kind, we must analyse two cases: the game is repeated a finite number of times, and the game is repeated an infinite number of times.

When the prisoners know the number of repetitions, it’s interesting to operate a backwards induction to solve the game. Consider the strategies of each player when they realise the next round is going to be the last. They behave as if it was a one-shot game, thus the Nash equilibrium applies, and the equilibrium would be confess-confess, just like in the one-time game. Now consider the game before the last. Since each player knows in the next, final round they are going to confess, there’s no advantage to lie (cooperate with each other) on this round either. The same logic applies for prior moves. Therefore, confess-confess is the Nash equilibrium for all rounds.

The situation with an infinite number of repetitions is different, since there will be no last round, a backwards induction reasoning does not work here. At each round, both prisoners reckon there will be another round and therefore there are always benefits arising form the cooperate (lie) strategy. However, prisoners must take into account punishment strategies, in case the other player confesses in any round.
